    <h1>Eid Mubarak!</h1>
     <p>
      On this blessed occasion of <span class="highlight">Eid ul-Adha</span>, may your life be as balanced as a Value Added Statement,
      your blessings compound like interest under Rule 72 and your happiness reflect an ever rising GDP of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as investment decisions bring future returns, may your acts of kindness and sacrifice bring eternal dividends of peace and love.
      May your labor be rewarded, your assets grow with barakah and your control risk stay low both in dunya and akhirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let this Eid inspire internal financing of faith, external financing of good deeds
      and global economic harmony through compassion, charity and community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celebrate with a heart free of liabilities, a soul rich in intangible assets like gratitude
      and a life full of optimum liquidity love, health and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the audit of actions to the terminal cash flow of life,
      may Allah accept your sacrifices, forgive your debts (sins) and add tax-free blessings to your every step.
    </p>
